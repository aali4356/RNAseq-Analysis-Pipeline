# **Network Analysis of microRNA Hubs in IgA Nephropathy**

---

## **Description**
To preface, this README.md file is written by AI. The full write-up for this is in the R markdown file. The following is a summarized version of what I did.
This project explores the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in IgA Nephropathy (IgAN), a chronic kidney disease linked to abnormal IgA1 glycosylation. By employing advanced network analysis, it identifies key miRNA hubs that may serve as biomarkers for disease progression and potential therapeutic targets. The study sheds light on the molecular mechanisms driving IgA1 glycosylation, aiming to advance the understanding of IgAN pathophysiology and support the development of precision medicine solutions.
